My Volvo dashboard icon showed that the tires are low! I saw on the worksheet that supposedly all four tires were checked and set at 42 mm Hg pressure. I'll go to a tire shop tomorrow to check the pressures but could it be that maintenance did not reset the computer?  I also saw that two tires were not balanced? I had to purchase two rear tires because they were worn out unevenly.  Can they clarify the comment made in my service report?
Should't the original tires last more than 25,000 miles? My Audi had a similar problem and it turned out to be a faulty mechanical device in the braking system.  Comments?

First off...I never had a chance to really thank you for your help with my service...the other folks were supposed to tell you after my car was finished charging since you had already gone home.
So...I wanted to talk to you about something else which is what made me remember your text from before.

Since I got the car back, after the car sits long enough when you first start it two amber lights show up on the dash.  If I turn the power off and restart it the lights stay off.  

This happened once after a service at Stevens Creek Nissan...and they wanted me to drive it 15 miles in with the lights on so they could check the codes.  I'm hoping something might show up in my factory records to know what it was.  I'm attaching a picture of the two lights on the dash that are lit up.  You can see the one amber triangle light with an exclamation point in it up where the speedometer is displayed, and the other down by where it says """" and is an amber car with an exclamation point.

Please let me know what needs to be done.  Hopefully there's something I can do to save a 30 mile drive...I have some technical skills.
Thanks,

20000347,Would've had liked the video better if the tire could have been fixed,SOMEWHAT_NEGATIVE
20000348,Hopefully you can check the left front break as well with a lot of break dust - was affected from the beginning,SOMEWHAT_NEGATIVE
20000349,Not interested at this time,SOMEWHAT_NEGATIVE
20000350,I liked the video but he recommended that I change all of the fluids but I changed all of them at one hundred thousand so I don't think he checked any of them . It's good to know about the oil leak.,SOMEWHAT_NEGATIVE

20000367,I just saw that. That is quite a bit of money especially after we have had this worked on 2 times before. Those were not inexpensive fixes either. Is there anything mazda can do since this is the same problem from before. Or it at least was not found before and the money we put to fix it the last 2 times was obviously incorrect,SOMEWHAT_NEGATIVE

My son was a service advisor at one time so I know what he went through at times. But I do think I should tell you I was a bit unhappy getting in my car that day and I probably should've said something. I appreciate the car wash but my floor mat was the direst it's ever been with wet and muddy feet. Then later I noticed two mechanic light black spots on my white interior door. I think someone needs to be more mindful of that . Thanks,SOMEWHAT_NEGATIVE

Then when I picked it up u had credited me juat $200 instead of the $500 that the discount coupon called for. So the whole experience felt like the quick $2000 money grab is really all u cared about. For this I'd give u a 1 or 2.

I've been bringing my car to you guys for years and it's always been expensive but I've figured the service and amenities were worth the expense but after yesterday, no thank you. I thought it was a little weird that when I pulled in everyone ignored me for a few minutes. Then after it got pretty awkward with me standing there, someone finally came out and had no idea what I was there for and promptly told me that since he doesnt do Mitsubishis he can't really help me but he'd get me started. I thought that was nice and he got me started and I'd switch over to someone who 'does' Mitsubishis. I told him I was due for a 70k service and he made it sound like that would be a huge ordeal, then actually looked at the sheet and said 'oh nevermind '. I'm a waiter so I hung out in the lounge which is fine as always, but normally someone comes out after they've seen the car and they explain what they're gonna do before they do it, with a price, etc. Nothing. The same guy who 'doesnt do Mitsubishis' came to tell me they were all done and to go to the register. No price. No explanation. Nothing. For all I know they didn't actually do anything to my car. I get to the register and God forbid I bother this woman with my money. ""What do you want?"" I said that the guy told me to come up here and pay and it was like I offended her. "" They must've been between shift change cause she had to clock in while 2 other people butt in front of her to clock out. Her dinner was dropped off then she asks for my paper, which I never got. This suddenly became my fault to her. At this point Javi comes back over and said he printed it out and low and behold it was right next to her in the printer where she never bothered to check. Mind you NO ONE HAS TOLD ME WHAT OR HOW MUCH IM PAYING STILL. She reached for my credit card and I said I had a coupon and at this point she rolled her eyes and told Javi that he'd have to fix it. Then she waved her hand at me and said BACK OF THE LINE! Im a nurse and I haven't had patients treat me as rudely as she was. As I wait in line and she helps the next people her dinner is delivered by another coworker and all kinds of statements are made in the back for literally everyone in the lounge to hear. Then I finally get to the front again and she's like ""oh, you again."" Again, still have no idea how much I'm paying.

I'm a 2022 Jeep Gladiator owner with a rear main seal issue. I wanted my original dealer to handle this repair. But between recalls being done and me taking it to my original dealer someone voided my warranty on claims of flood damage. Yet my jeep has never ever been flooded. It was never even driven in the amount of water that my model is slated to be capable of driving in. 
I now have to chase Chrysler Motors around to get warranty reinstated with whatever they require of me to do that. Yet they required no proof at all of ""flood damage"" to void my warranty. 
So word to the wise if your considering a jeep for your next purchase DONT. I've had 3 now. And i assure you this is my last one. 
Worst customer experience of my life. 
We will sell you a dream to get you to buy our product but if you don't shrink wrap it and leave it in garage for special occasions your warranty is meaningless.

I had it towed to you and you kept it for three days and said you couldn't find anything wrong with it and told me to drive it more. A month later it stopped again in the middle of the street. You kept it for two weeks and again told me nothing was wrong with it. So now I have a car that I'm afraid to drive more than a ten minute walk from my home. I'm now faced with the prospect of having to get rid of a car that I love because it's unsafe to drive.

C) would the first item on the asr then be reimbursed since it was done at the request of the party that wishes to avoid the cost of fixing the main problem in the first place? 
2) The first asr item also says that a failing transmission pressure control solenoid can cause slipping but there hasn't been any slipping so this asr is addressing a symptom that the car does not have. Why treat a sunroom first is not there? 
Summary... That asr is $438.59. Isn't that pretty darn expensive for something that is being done to protect Honda and is not addressing the symptoms this car is reported to have?",VERY_NEGATIVE

Only thing I've been able to do was lock my cc. I've checked the entire truck. It's nowhere to be found. I work just as hard as everyone else. I don't appreciate this at all. The very best thing...You guys didn't tighten my oil filter and my driveway had oil leaks. It was leaking from the filter. I didn't expect this at all. I had a friend look under and the filter wasn't tightened. It was loose. This is not something I expected. This is something that you all need to double check.

41750900,"Hey Karl, 

I saw the video! Thank you! 

I had a feeling it was a head gasket leak. How much does that cost to do at the dealership? 

I saw he couldn't replicate what i meant about the engine surging. It happens after I do a cold start and let it warm up in the mornings. It isn't so much as a jerk, as it is the rpms being irregular after being in idle. The rpm sits around 1,000 and 1,500 when I start the engine and let it idle for a few minutes then it drops down.

Do you know if he was able to check the Idle control valve or if there's issues with the fuel injectors? 
Are there any vaccum leaks?
How are the Spark plugs?

First, for the tire balancing, I just had the tires fully replaced about a year and a half ago after an accident. They were replaced and balanced at north Penn Mazda. Being that it's a Mazda dealership, I'm wondering if I should take it back there if it was done incorrectly. Second, for the brake repair, I will definitely go ahead with that, however, will fully replacing the brake pads last longer? I know it's more expensive, but if by cutting them I'll have to end up replacing them sooner I may consider replacement",POSITIVE

41747231,"Thanks.   As the spark plugs were new in July 2022, replace the broken one with the same as the other 3.  Were the threads damaged in the head removing the broken plug?  When the head is out I expect your tech will carefully inspect and look for anything iffy with valve train, etc.  If the spark plug holes look the least rough, it would be nice to run a well oiled tap through them.  Also the condition of the cylinder walls.

I would like the EGR system cleaned for an additional $180.  Save the head gasket & broken plug for me.  

Thanks, Paul",POSITIVE

Tires, those tires should've been replaced before I bought the truck. Those tires had been on that vehicle since 2017 when I bought it. I think y'all can push the claim and get me some tires. Last time, I felt completely mishandled because only one was replaced.

Hi Dr. Sous,

Happy to jump on a call if you would like us to, but I want to let you know that I have come off the Lorazepam and I am now on 40 mg of Hydoxzyine i.e., 4 tablets of 10 mg each.  I find I am sleeping well, or even better.

I was prescribed only 2 tablets per day.  When you get a chance could change the prescription to 40 mg of Hydroxzyine per day and I don’t think I will need the Lorazepam any longer.

Thank you

Best

    Thank you so much for sending me the video.  Helped me understand a little better.  
    How much does flow charge for the kind of tires I need and does it include all maintenance until I need new ones again? 
    Also, could the axle have been damaged when I was hit and had to replace the right back door and back fender?  
   Last question today-  can I and should I reapply for warranty?  If so, where do you suggest?

I was researching this last night and it is a common problem with the Pathfinder. If you could ask the mechanic to inspect the CV JOINTS i appreciate this.

I just called CNA they said they can't do much as they are getting the information solely through you/Kia service department. I will call Kia Corporate next and hope they are willing to cover the cost. 

However, CNA stated that the check engine light has been on for over a year - which was not true. The check engine light turned on on Wednesday and that's when the car started making a weird noise. That's why we pulled over and called a tow-truck to get the car checked at the dealership. Also, regarding the catalytic converter; Per your first email ""it was recommended in 2022"" to get it replaced but we were not made aware that it needed to be replaced or that there was anything wrong with the car when we first purchased it.

Also, the Jiffy Lube invoice from January lists the mileage as 197,733 which is incorrect as well. How can one be sure that the oil changes weren't being being done within the 10k mile range? 

Thank you for all your help.
